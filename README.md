# Canonical Correlation Analysis Between the Factor and Effect of Climate Change in Indonesia
------------

# DESCRIPTION 
This project focuses on understanding the relationship between the factors contributing to climate change and the effects it causes in various provinces of Indonesia. Utilizing Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), this study explores the correlation between two groups of variables: factors influencing climate change and the impacts of climate change. The analysis aims to identify key relationships and provide insights into the socio-economic and environmental effects of climate change across Indonesia.

# OBJECTIVES 
1. Analyze the correlation between climate change factors and its impacts in Indonesian provinces using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).
2. Conduct and satisfy the assumptions of multicollinearity, normality, and linearity to ensure the accuracy and validity of the statistical model.
3. Identify significant canonical functions that represent the relationships between the influencing factors and the resulting impacts of climate change.

# WORKFLOW 
- Data Collection:

   - The data is sourced from open governmental records in Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik). Two groups of variables are analyzed:
      - Group X (Factors): Rainfall intensity, average annual temperature, traffic density, number of flood disasters.
      - Group Y (Effects): Forest land cover, flood disaster fatalities, availability of residential areas affected, population affected by floods.
- Data Preparation:

   - Pre-process the data for canonical analysis by ensuring it satisfies the multicollinearity, normality, and linearity assumptions.
   - Conduct data standardization so that the data can be used for modeling.
   - Transform the data as needed to meet the normality requirement.
- Multicollinearity Test:

   - Use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to assess whether there is significant correlation between the independent variables within each group.
- Normality Test:

   - Perform the Shapiro-Wilk test after applying several data transformations to confirm that the data follows a normal distribution.
- Linearity Test:

   - Examine the linearity of relationships between variables by utilizing the Pearson correlation method.
- Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA):

   - Compute canonical functions to evaluate the strength of relationships between the groups of variables and identify which functions have a significant impact on the results.
- Statistical Testing:

   - Conduct simultaneous and partial tests to evaluate the significance of the canonical functions.

#  CONCLUSION 
This study successfully applied Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to analyze the relationships between climate change factors and their effects in Indonesia. The following conclusions were drawn:

- Assumptions Fulfilled: The data met the necessary assumptions for multicollinearity, normality, and linearity.
- Significant Canonical Function: The first canonical function was found to significantly explain the relationship between climate change factors (Group X) and the effects (Group Y), accounting for 47.3% of the variability.
